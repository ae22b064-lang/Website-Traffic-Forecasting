Website Traffic Forecasting using Python
This project demonstrates how to forecast website traffic using the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model in Python. The forecasting is based on a dataset of daily traffic data.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to predict future website traffic by analyzing historical data. The data is time-series based, and since it shows seasonal patterns (e.g., daily or weekly cycles), a SARIMA model is used for accurate predictions.
