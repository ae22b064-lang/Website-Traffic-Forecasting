# Website Traffic Forecasting using Python (SARIMA)

This project demonstrates how to **forecast website traffic** using the **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)** model in Python.  
The model leverages daily traffic data to identify **seasonal patterns** (e.g., weekly cycles) and generate accurate predictions of future trends.

## Project Overview
- **Objective** → Predict future website traffic using historical time-series data.  
- **Model** → Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), well-suited for data with trends and seasonality.  
- **Outcome** → Forecasted traffic values with visualization to support data-driven decisions (e.g., server scaling, marketing campaigns).
